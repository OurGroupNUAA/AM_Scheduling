**This file provides instructions for interpreting the instance naming convention used in our experiments.**

For example, |P|=10_|M|=2,3,4_run1 refers to the instance used in the first experimental run for the combination (|P|=10,|M|=2), (|P|=10,|M|=3) and (|P|=10,|M|=4).

Similarly, |P|=10_|M|=2,3,4_run2 refers to the instance used in the second experimental run for the combination (|P|=10,|M|=2), (|P|=10,|M|=3) and (|P|=10,|M|=4).

Moreover, for each instance, either the optimal objective value (if found) or the best achieved objective value obtained within the time limit of 3600 seconds is provided in the corresponding Excel sheet.
